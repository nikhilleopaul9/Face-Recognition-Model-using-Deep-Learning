# Face-Recognition-Model-using-Deep-Learning
Face Recognition Model using Deep Learning technique know as Deep metric Learning

Perform face recognition in both images and video cam streams using:

-OpenCV
-dlib
-Python
-Deep learning
As weâ€™ll see, the deep learning-based facial embeddings are both /
(1) highly accurate and (2) capable of being executed in real-time.
