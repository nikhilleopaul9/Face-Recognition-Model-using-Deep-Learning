# Face-Recognition-Model-using-Deep-Learning
Face Recognition Model using Deep Learning technique know as Deep metric Learning

Perform face recognition in both images and video cam streams using:

**-OpenCV**

**-dlib**

**-Python**

**-Deep learning**

The deep learning-based facial embeddings are both:- 

**(1) highly accurate and (2) capable of being executed in real-time.**

## Understanding deep learning face recognition embeddings

Instead, of trying to output a single label (or even the coordinates/bounding box of objects in an image), we are instead outputting a real-valued feature vector.

For the dlib facial recognition network, the output feature vector is 128-d (i.e., a list of 128 real-valued numbers) that is used to quantify the face. Training the network is done using triplets:
